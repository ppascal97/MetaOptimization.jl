    benchmark_set(Pbs::Vector{AbstractNLPModels},solver::tunedOptimizer;valid_ratio=0.1,load_dict::String="",weights=true)

Pick valid problems from `Pbs` (which have a strictly positive weight in `solver.weightPerf`) and randomly separate them into two sets : training
and validation. Return a tuple (trainingProblems,validationProblems) containing two vectors of NLP models.

# **Arguments** :

- `Pbs::Vector{AbstractNLPModel}`

The set of problems to process

- `solver::tunedOptimizer`

The solver containing the weights dictionary.

# **Optional arguments** :

- `weights::Bool`

If false, information from weights dictionary is not taken into account.
`true` by default.

- `valid_ratio::Float`

The proportion of problems used for validation among all problems
`0.1` by default.

- `load_dict::String`

If it is a valid existing .csv file name, solver.weightPerf is replaced with the data from this file at the beginning of the process.
empty by default.
